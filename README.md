# Word Unscrambler 🧩

Word Unscrambler is a simple web application that helps you find words based on various criteria such as word length, letters to include, letters to avoid, and specific positions of letters within the word.

## Why I Built This Project? 🌟

I was playing a word guessing game on Binance, and I kept running out of chances after a few tries. I searched online for help, but I couldn't find a word unscrambler that met my needs. Most of them didn't let me specify where certain letters should go in the word.

For example, if the word was 5 letters long and I knew 'a' and 'e' were in it, and I also know 'a' is in the first spot, I needed a way to tell the unscrambler that. But none of the unscrambler in the market had that option.

So, I decided to build one with all the features I needed. I hoped it would help others like me who were frustrated with the existing options.

And as for my own game on Binance, using my unscrambler, I finally solved it on my last try. The adrenaline rush and the dopamine hit me beautifully when I saw the result. It was a big relief!
